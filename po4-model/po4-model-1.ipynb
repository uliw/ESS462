The resulting evolution of the marine phosphate concentration can then be described as\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{}\n\\frac{d[PO_4]}{dt} = F_w(t) - F_b(t)\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $[PO_4]$ denotes the phosphate concentration, $t$ denotes time, and $dt$ the change with time.\n\n![img](./images/reservoir.png)\n\nFor this experiment we assume that F<sub>w</sub> is constant, and that F<sub>b</sub> depends simply on the  phosphate concentration. So we can rewrite this equation as\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{}\n\\frac{d[PO4]}{dt} = F_w - c \\times [PO4]\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $c$ is a constant (in the below model, `c = 7e4`). In the following, we will use numerical integration to solve this equation over a time span of 1Myrs.\n\nIf you are a bit more mathematically minded, you may have noticed that reaching steady state implies that there is no longer any change in the phosphate concentration. In this case, the left side of the above equations becomes zero, and we can rearrange the equation as:\n\n$$ F_w = c \\times [PO4] $$\n\nrearranging this terms allows you to calculate the steady state concentration as \n$$ [PO4] = \\frac{F_w}{c} $$\nHowever, most of the time this will be a bit more involved,  so will use the a model here. \n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Model boundary conditions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Find the values for `F_r` , `V` in your notes, and edit the below code accordingly.
