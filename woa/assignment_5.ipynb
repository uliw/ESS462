This process additionally requires nitrate and phosphate, resulting in organic matter with fairly uniform C:N:P ratios, the so called Redfield ratio (106:16:1). In addition, photosynthesis creates oxygen as a byproduct. \n\nSettling organic matter transports these elements from the surface ocean into the deep ocean. This process is termed export production and/or biological carbon pump.\n\nOrganic matter decomposes while sinking into the deep ocean, a \nprocess that consumes oxygen, and liberates phosphate and nitrate. This process is referred to as remineralization or respiration.  Ocean mixing via the thermohaline circulation returns those nutrients back to the surface ocean.\n\n![img](./my_images/OM_cycling.png)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### Phosphate\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["In the left pane you should see a file called `woa_phosphate.ipynb`.
