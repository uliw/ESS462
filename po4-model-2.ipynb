    "In the following, we use a two box ocean model. The surface box represents the `photic zone`  of the ocean, and the deep-box represents the `deep ocean` that is below the photic zone.  The mode approximates the `thermohaline circulation` by two fluxes, $F_u$ which describes the upwelling of deep water, and $F_d$ which describes the downwelling of surface water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marine primary productivity (i.e., photosynthesis) is typically limited by the availability of dissolved phosphate. In order to keep the model simple, we assume a linear relationship between the Phosphate concentration and the amount of `organic matter` that is produced by photosynthesis. Since we are only interested in Phosphate, there are no terms for organic matter (OM) production. However, since OM will eventually sink into the deep ocean, the organic bound Phosphate will also sink into the deep ocean. I will call this settling flux $F_{POC}$ which stands for \"Particulate Organic Phosphate\". So we can express  $F_POC$ as being proportional to the PO<sub>4</sub> concentration:\n",
