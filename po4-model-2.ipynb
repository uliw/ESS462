The surface box represents the `photic zone`  of the ocean, and the deep-box represents the `deep ocean` that is below the photic zone.  The mode approximates the `thermohaline circulation` by two fluxes, $F_u$ which describes the upwelling of deep water, and $F_d$ which describes the downwelling of surface water.\n\nMarine primary productivity (i.e., photosynthesis) is typically limited by the availability of dissolved phosphate. In order to keep the model simple, we assume a linear relationship between the Phosphate concentration and the amount of `organic matter` that is produced by photosynthesis. Since we are only interested in Phosphate, there are no terms for organic matter (OM) production. However, since OM will eventually sink into the deep ocean, the organic bound Phosphate will also sink into the deep ocean. I will call this settling flux $F_{POP}$ which stands for \"Particulate Organic Phosphate\". So we can express  $F_{POP}$ as being proportional to the PO<sub>4</sub> concentration:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{}\nF_{POP} = [PO_4] \\times \\frac{V_S}{\\tau}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $\\tau$ is a constant, and $V_S$ is the volume of the surface box. Now, why the so complicated? Consider the definition of the residence time:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{}\nR_t = \\frac{M}{F}\n\\end{equation}\n\nif we re-arrange this, we get:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{}\nF = \\frac{M}{R_t}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhich is the same as $F_{POP}$ equation above.  In other words, $\\tau$ is the residence time of phosphate in the surface ocean.  Neat!\n\nWe can now describe the equations that govern [PO<sub>4</sub>] in the surface and deep ocean\n\n![img](./images/mpc.png)\n\nSimilar to the previous  model, our fluxes are not static (with the exception of the weathering flux). $F_u$ and $F_b$ depend on the velocity of thermohaline circulation, and the respective phosphate concentration in each box:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{}\nF_u = thc \\times [PO_4]_{D}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere `thc` denotes the velocity of  the thermohaline circulation, and $[PO_4]_D$ the concentration in the deep ocean.  A similar equation can be written for $F_d$. \n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### The burial flux\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Most of the sinking organic matter will be `remineralized` in the deep\nocean. For our model, we sill assume that the remineralization efficiency is\nabout 99% percent. I.e., only 1% percent of the marine export productivity is\nburied in the sediments. We can thus write:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{}\nF_b = F_{POP} \\times (1 -\\epsilon)\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $\\epsilon$ denotes the burial efficiency (i.e., 99% = 0.99). \n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Model Equations\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["For the PO4 concentration in the surface ocean, we can write:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{}\n\\frac{[PO_{4}]_{S}}{dt} = F_w + [PO_{4}]_{D} \\times thc - [PO_{4}]_{S} \\times thc - [PO_{4}]_{S} \\times \\frac{V_S}{\\tau}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand for the deep ocean:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{}\n\\frac{[PO_4]_S}{dt} =  [PO_4]_S \\times \\frac{V_S}{\\tau} \\times \\epsilon + [PO_4]_{S} \\times thc - [PO_4]_{D} \\times thc\n\\end{equation}\n\nNote that both equations depend on each other, i.e., we need to know the result from one equation to calculate the result of the other equation (i.e., coupled differential equations).\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Model boundary conditions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["As before, use your notes to find the missing boundary condition data below, and edit the code accordingly.
